react-native EventSource
_NOTE_: Comparing to base repository, this fork 
uses [travisjeffery/TRVSEventSource](https://github.com/travisjeffery/TRVSEventSource) library
as base for iOS implementation.
=========================

Server-Sent Events for your React Native apps!

EventSource implementation following the W3C EventSource specification.

_NOTE_: This is my first time playing with Obj-C and Java and the iOS and Android ecosystems. If you
see something that makes you go :frowning: please let me know. PRs are always welcome!

## Installing

```bash
npm install react-native-eventsource --save

react-native link react-native-eventsource
```

## Usage

Full example that subscribes to a SSE stream and writes the results to `console.log`

```js
var React = require('react-native');
var {
  AppRegistry,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View,
} = React;

var EventSource = require('react-native-eventsource');

var example = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      source: null,
      url: 'YOUR_ENDPOINT',
    };
  },

  componentDidMount() {
    this.source = new EventSource(this.state.url);

    this.source.onopen = function () {
      console.log('EventSource::onopen');
    };

    this.source.onmessage = function (e) {
      console.log('EventSource::onmessage: ', e);
    };

    this.source.onerror = function (e) {
      console.log('EventSource::onerror: ', e);
    };

    this.source.addEventListener("custom_event", function(e) {
      console.log('EventSource::custom_event: ', e);
    };
  },

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.source.close();
  },

  render: function() {
    return (<View><Text>SSE in React!</Text></View>);
  }
});
```
